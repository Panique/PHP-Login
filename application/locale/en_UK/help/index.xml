        This box (everything between header and footer) is the content of views/help/index.php,
        so it's the help/index view. It's rendered by the index-method within the help-controller
        (in controllers/help.php). You can easily create a sub-page by putting a method into the
        controller and a view into the view folder. So, if you want to create something like
        a FAQ section within &quot;Help&quot;, then put
        &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;function faq() { $this-&gt;view-&gt;render('help/faq'); }&lt;/span&gt;
        into controllers/help.php and create an according view in views/help/, named &quot;faq.php&quot;.
        Now you can use that by simply navigation to &quot;help/faq&quot; in your app: If your app is on
        http://localhost/myapp/ then this section is now on http://localhost/myapp/help/faq !
        Try it out...
